\section{W$\gamma$ Production Theory and Former Experimental Results} % 5-10 pages
\label{sec:WgAbout}

Chapter~\ref{sec:WgAbout} provides deeper theoretical background for the measurement of this dissertation and discusses former experimental results. The derivation of the electroweak Lagrangian is described in Ch.~\ref{sec:WgAbout_SMEWK}, including the appearance of TGC and QGC terms. Then concepts of the cross section and the luminosity are discussed in Ch.~\ref{sec:WgAbout_LumiAndCS}. More specific details regarding the SM cross section of W$\gamma$ are summarized in Ch.~\ref{sec:WgAbout_SMproduction}. Possible causes and potential effects of aTGC are explained in Ch.~\ref{sec:WgAbout_ATGC}. Finally, Ch.~\ref{sec:WgAbout_PastMeasurements} lists former physics experiments which probed the same aTGC vertex which is probed in the measurement of this dissertation including measurments of exactly the same process at lower LHC beam energy.\\
