% Do not start paragraph with “here are the diagrams”.
%   This section needs to be improved as well. I would not like to go line by line, and not sure how to give general comments.
%For example, the total proton mass/energy is not just invariant mass coming from the kinetic energy of the three valence quarks. I vaguely remember that O(50%) of it is sitting in kinetic energy of gluons.
%> The mass of a proton is an invariant mass of a system of the quarks which is mostly
%> comprised of their kinetic energy.
%What is comprised of kineatic energy? The system of the quarks? The invariant mass? The language is not clear enough (and either way I think it is not correct).
%Another example of a set of short loosely connected sentences that you have all throughout the text:
%> These three quarks are called valence quarks. They interact with each other by exchanging
%> gluons. Gluons emit other gluons and produce qq ̄ pairs. Such virtual quarks are
%> called sea quarks.
%Please avoid this style.
%It is not clear what this chapter has to do with the rest of your thesis. Ok, you explained that protons have this structure, and at the LHC you can have qq, qg, gg collisions. So what, how is it relevant?

The schemes of the proton structure and a proton-proton collision are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ppCollision}. A proton consists of three quarks: uud. An electric charge of a proton is a sum of the quarks charges: Q=+2/3+2/3-1/3=1. The situation with the mass is different: the mass of a u quark is 6 GeV and the mass of a d quark is 3 GeV while the mass of a proton is 940 GeV. The mass of a proton is an invariant mass of a system of the quarks which is mostly comprised of their kinetic energy. These three quarks are called valence quarks. They interact with each other by exchanging gluons. Gluons emit other gluons and produce $q\bar{q}$ pairs. Such virtual quarks are called sea quarks.

If two low energetic protons interact, it corresponds to the large distance between them and such protons do not probe one another's structure. They see each other as colorless electrically charged particles and therefore interact electromagnetically by exchanging a photon. Protons of higher energy see one another's intrinsic structure: its constituents, quarks, antiquarks and gluons, interact strongly with each other. Valence quarks, as well as sea quarks and antiquarks, can participate in the couplings.

In LHC collisions quark-(anti)quark, gluon-(anti)quark, gluon-gluon interactions are all possible however at such high energies, gluon-gluon interactions are prevalent. That is why the LHC sometimes is being called the gluon collider.

One important specific of high energetic proton collisions is the fact that an interacting particle possesses only part of a proton energy and momentum. Therefore, the energies and longitudinal momenta of the initial state particles are unknown. Although, the total transverse momenta is known to be equal to zero.
