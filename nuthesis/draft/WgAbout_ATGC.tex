\subsection{Anomalous $W\gamma$ Production}
\label{sec:WgAbout_ATGC}

Triple and quartic gauge couplings (QGC) are represented by vertices with three and four bosons (Fig. \ref{fig:TGC_and_QGC_vertices}). TGC and QGC can be charged or neutral. There are variety of the SM processes where charged TGC and QGC are possible. Such processes can occur through a Feynman diagram with a vertex involving a $W$ boson and conserving charge. Corresponding vertices are $WW\gamma$, $WWZ$, $WWWW$, $WW\gamma\gamma$, $WWZ\gamma$, and $WWZZ$ (Fig. \ref{fig:TGC_and_QGC_vertices}, 1$^st$, 3$^rd$, and 5$^th$ diagrams). To search for the new physics, all these vertices are described by extended Largangian term than the SM description, involving several constants which have known values in the SM. A significant deviation of one of these constants from the known values would be an indication of a new physics.\\

As for neutral TGC and QGC, they are forbidden in the SM at the tree level but extended Lagrangian contains terms which describes neutral TGC and QGC vertices: $Z\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma$, $ZZZ$, $Z\gamma\gamma\gamma$, $ZZ\gamma\gamma$, $ZZZ\gamma$, and $ZZZZ$. Similarly to charge TGC and QGC cases, neutral TGC and QGC Largangian terms involve contants which are zero in the SM.\\

In $W\gamma$ measurement we can probe $WW\gamma$ vertex only. The most general Lorentz invariant Lagrangian of this vertex takes the following form \cite{ref_theory_aTGC}:\\

$i L_{eff}^{WW\gamma}= e [ g_1^{\gamma} A^\mu (W_{\mu\nu}^- W^{+\nu} - W_{\mu\nu}^+ W^{-\nu}) + \kappa_\gamma W_{\mu}^+ W_{\nu}^- A^{\mu\nu} + {\frac{\lambda_\gamma}{m^2_W}} A^{\mu\nu} W_\nu^{+\rho} W_{\rho\mu}^- + i g_5^\gamma \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}((\partial^\rho W^{-\mu})W^{+\nu} - W^{-\mu}(\partial^{\rho}W^{+\nu}))V^\sigma + i g_4^\gamma W_\mu^- W_\nu^+ (\partial^\mu A^\nu + \partial^\nu A^\mu) - \frac{\tilde{\kappa_\gamma}}{2} W_\mu^- W_\nu^+ \epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} A_{\rho\sigma} - \frac{\tilde{\lambda_\gamma}}{2 m_W^2} W_{\rho\mu}^- W^{+\mu}_{\nu} \epsilon^{\nu\rho\alpha\beta} A_{\alpha\beta}] $\\

where $e$ is the absolute value of the electron charge, $A^\mu$ is the photon field, $W^{\pm\mu}$ are fileds of $W^\pm$ bosons, $W_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu W_\nu - \partial_\nu W_\mu$, $A_{\mu\nu}=\partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$, $m_W$ is the mass of a $W$ boson, $g_1^\gamma$, $\kappa_\gamma$, $\lambda_\gamma$, $g_5^\gamma$, $g_4^\gamma$, $\tilde{\kappa_\gamma}$, and $\tilde{\lambda_\gamma}$ are constants.\\

Despite there are 7 constants in the extended Lagrangian, only $\lambda_\gamma$ and $\kappa_\gamma$ are considered in the BSM searches. The rest of the constants are fixed to their SM values based on various considerations. Thus, $g_1^\gamma=1$ and $g_5^\gamma=0$ are fixed to obey the electromagnatic gauge invariance for the on-shell photons. The non-zero value of $g_5^\gamma$ also violates C and P conservations, and non-zero values of $g_4^\gamma$, $\tilde{\kappa_\gamma}$, $\tilde{\lambda_\gamma}$ violate the CP conservation law. Such violation parametrizations are not considered in charged TGC measurements now but might get considered in the future.\\
