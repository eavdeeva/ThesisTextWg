\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%   The content, to my view, is fine, although stylistically can be improved.
%   The description of your analysis is in the right place, but needs to be improved.

Elementary particle physics describes our world in terms of its smallest constituents, elementary particles, and their interactions. 

% Next paragraph is about only one particular kind of matter
% Try to rephrase. Maybe, read similar pargraph in Griffiths or somewhere else
Any matter consists of chunks and as far as we go to smaller and smaller scale, it consists of fundamental particles which cannot be split any further. Talking about substances which consist of molecules, molecules consist of atoms, in an atom, there is a nucleus made of neutrons and protons and some number of electrons occupying their orbits around the nucleus. Protons and neutrons have a structure while an electron is not known to have any structure, therefore, an electron is a fundamental particle.

% Also, for this paragraph: rephrase, not quite clear and correct information
Interactions of elementary particles are described by quantum field theories which incorporate principles of the quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity. The collection of such theories which describe the behavior of elementary particles , including quantum elecrtrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics and the theory of weak interactions is called the Standard Model. It has been proven to be an appropriate description of interactions of elementary particles observed by now. The accuracy of the SM is as good as or better than experimental results.

However, there are several experimental observations which are not described by the SM such as gravity, dark matter, dark energy, matter/antimatter asymmetry and others. Therefore, the SM is not the complete theory of particle interactions but one which is working in the experimental conditions available. There are several SM extensions offered by theorists as well as radically new theories waiting for the experimental confirmation or disproval. 

Some SM extensions and new theories predict the existence of heavy particles mass of which possibly lays beyond the discovered energy threshold. The search of these particles is the way to search for new physics. For such searches we need to reach higher energies which were probed before. One source of highly energetic elementary particles is cosmic rays. The most energetic particles ever came from this source. However, cosmic rays are totally uncontrollable and such highly energetic particles are rare. If we want to produce a large amount of particles at certain energies, we need to use a particle accelerator. A large amount of events at certain energy allows to perform a statitical analysis and increase the probability to find a new particles if it exists in the given energy range.

To produce as heavy particles as possible, symmetric colliding beams work the best because the total momentum of two symmetrically colliding particles is zero and the whole energy can potentially go to production of new particles. The Large Hadron Collider is the collider with the highest energy in the world ever, it can produce the most massive particles to probe physics beyond the SM. It collides two proton beams with the several TeV of energy each. The highest center-of-mass energy LHC will work with is 14 TeV but it also probes several lower energy points. 

Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of two general-purpose detectors at the LHC placed at the collision point. CMS has a wide physics program including searches for different SM extensions as well as the precision measurements of the SM itself.  

In this dissertation the analysis of inclusive $W\gamma + X$  processes using  leptonic decays of $W\to \ell\nu$ where $\ell = e, \mu$ is reported. The $W\gamma$ productions with leptonic W decays can go through one of the following three processes: initial state radiation (ISR) where a photon is produced from one of the incoming partons, final state radiation (FSR) where a photon is radiated off the charged lepton from the $W$ boson decay, and finally when a photon is produced via the triple gauge coupling (TGC) where a photon is emitted from the W boson. A W boson is a charged particle, therefore, the TGC is possible in the SM (Fig. \ref{fig:feynmWg}).

To search for the deviations from the SM, one would try to find an anomalous TGC (aTGC) which would be indicated by the TGC production to have much larger probability than expected from the SM prediction. 

The total and the differential cross section with respect to $P_T^{\gamma}$ has been measured. The $P_T^{\gamma}$ is sensitive to the potential aTGC in the high $P_T^{\gamma}$ region. The disagreement between the measured and theoretically predicted $d\sigma/dP_T^{\gamma}$ differential cross section at the higher $P_T^{\gamma}$ end would be an indication of the possible presence of the aTGC. The presence of the aTGC would be an indirect indication of a new particles.
