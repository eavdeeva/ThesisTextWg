\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The elementary particle physics studies our World in terms of its the smallest constituents: the elementary particles. All the matter consists of the molecules and the molecules consist of atoms. In an atom, there is a nucleus made of neutrons and protons and some number of electrons occupying their orbits around the nucleus. Protons and neutrons have a structure while an electron is not known to have any structure: it is a fundamental particle.

The interactions of the elementary particles can not be described by classical mechanics laws. For the objects which have sizes comparable to the Plank length, we have to use the quantum mechanics. For the speeds close to the speed of light, the special relativity is used. In particle physics, the objects are always small and are typically fast and are described by the quantum field theory.

The theory describing the behavior of elementary particles is called the Standard Model (SM). It has been proven to be an accurate description of the production of elementary particles observed so far. However, there are several experimental observations which are not described by the SM (gravity, dark matter, dark energy, matter/antimatter asymmetry). Therefore, the SM is not the complete theory of particle interactions but the one which is working in certain conditions. There are several SM extensions offered by theorists waiting for the experimantal confirmation or disproval. 

There are three types of the particle physics experiments: cosmic rays, nuclear reactors and accelerators. Cosmic rays are free (do not require any machinery to be produced) and some of them can be very energetic. However, this source of particles is uncontrollable and the particles with very high energies can be rare. Nuclear reactors are moderately expensive and provide low-energetic particles coming from nuclear decays. Large accelerators are the most expensive way to study particle physics but they are well-controllable and allow to produce as many particles as needed with given energy. An accelerator can produce a beam which would hit a target or an accelerator can be a collider and produce a beam which would hit another beam. In the case of the symmetric meeting beams, the total momentum of two colliding particles is zero and the whole energy can potentially go to production of a new particle. Thus, meeting beams can create the most massive particles and should be used to study particle physics at the highest energy frontier.

Some SM extensions predict the existence of heavy particles beyond the discovered energy threshold. The search of these particles is the way to search for the SM extensions.  

The Large Hadron Collider is the collider with the highest energy in the World ever, it can produce the most massive particles to probe physics beyond the SM. It collides two proton beams with the several TeV of energy each. The highest center-of-mass energy LHC will work with is 14 TeV but it also probes several lower energy points. 

Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of two general-purpose detectors at the LHC placed at the collision point. CMS has a wide physics program including searches for different SM extensions as well as the precision measurements of the SM itself.  

In this dissertation the analysis of inclusive $W\gamma + X$  processes using  leptonic decays of $W\to \ell\nu$ where $\ell = e, \mu$ is reported. The $W\gamma$ productions with leptonic W decays can go through one of the following three processes: initial state radiation (ISR) where a photon is produced from one of the incoming partons, final state radiation (FSR) where a photon is radiated off the charged lepton from the $W$ boson decay, and finally when a photon is produced via the triple gauge coupling (TGC) where a photon is emitted from the W boson. A W boson is a charged particle, therefore, the TGC is possible in the SM. The interaction of W bosons with photons is particularly important as a test of the self-coupling of these bosons as predicted by the electroweak sector. To search for the deviations from the SM, one would try to find an anomalous TGC (aTGC) which would be indicated by the TGC production to have much larger probability than expected from the SM prediction.

The total and the differential cross section with respect to $P_T^{\gamma}$ has been measured. The $P_T^{\gamma}$ is sensitive to the potential aTGC in the high $P_T^{\gamma}$ region. The disagreement between the measured and theoretically predicted $d\sigma/dP_T^{\gamma}$ differential cross section at the higher $P_T^{\gamma}$ end would be an indication of the possible presence of the aTGC.
