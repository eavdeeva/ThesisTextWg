\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


Elementary particle physics describes our world in terms of its smallest constituents, fundamental particles, and their interactions. Going from larger to smaller scales, substances around us consist of molecules, molecules consist of atoms, in an atom, there is a nucleus made of neutrons and protons and some number of electrons occupying their orbits around the nucleus. Protons and neutrons have a structure while an electron is not known to have any structure, therefore, an electron is an example of a particle which is considered to be fundamental.\\

Interactions of elementary particles are described by quantum field theories which incorporate principles of the quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity. The set of such theories, including quantum elecrtrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics and the theory of weak interactions is called the Standard Model (SM). It has been proven to be an accurate description of interactions of elementary particles observed by now.\\ 

However, there are several experimental observations which are not described by the SM such as gravity, dark matter, dark energy, matter/antimatter asymmetry and others. Therefore, the SM is not the complete theory of particle interactions. There are several SM extensions offered by theorists as well as radically new theories waiting for the experimental confirmation or disproval. \\

Some SM extensions and new theories predict the existence of heavy particles mass of which possibly lies beyond experimentally reachable energies. The search of these particles is one of the prioritized directions in particle physics. For such searches we need to reach higher energies which were probed before. One source of highly energetic elementary particles is cosmic rays. The most energetic particles ever observed came from this source. However, cosmic rays are totally uncontrollable and such highly energetic particles are rare. If we want to produce a large number of particles at certain energies, we need to use a particle accelerator. A large number of events at certain energy allows experimentalists to perform a statistical analysis and increase the probability of finding a new particle if it exists in the given energy range.\\

Symmetric colliding beams is the most effective way to produce as heavy particles as possible given the energies of the colliding particles. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is such a collider with the highest energy in the world ever built. It can produce the most massive particles to probe physics beyond the SM. It collides two proton beams with the several TeV of energy each. The design center-of-mass energy of is 14 TeV but it also probes several lower energy points and may go higher. \\

Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is one of two general-purpose detectors at the LHC. It is placed at one of six collision points. CMS has a wide physics program including searches for different SM extensions as well as the precision measurements of the SM parameters themselves. The chapter \ref{sec:Exp} describes LHC and CMS in more details.\\

In this dissertation the analysis of $pp\rightarrow W\gamma + X$  processes using  leptonic decays of $W\to \ell\nu$ where $\ell = e, \mu$ is reported. The $W\gamma$ productions with leptonic $W$ decays can go through one of the following three processes: initial state radiation where a photon is produced from one of the incoming partons, final state radiation where a photon is radiated off the charged lepton from the $W$ boson decay, and finally when a photon is produced via the triple gauge coupling (TGC) where a photon is emitted from the $W$ boson. \\ 

To search for the deviations from the SM, one would search for an anomalous TGC which would be indicated by the enchance of the TGC production over the SM prediction. \\

The total and the differential cross section with respect to the photon transverse momentum ($P_T^\gamma$) has been measured. The $P_T^{\gamma}$ is sensitive to the potential anomalous TGC in the high $P_T^{\gamma}$ region. The disagreement between the measured and theoretically predicted differential cross section at the higher $P_T^{\gamma}$ end would be an indication of the possible presence of the anomalous TGC. The theoretical descriptions of the SM and anomalous TGC $W\gamma$ productions are available in the chapter \ref{sec:WgAbout} of this dissertation. Chapter \ref{sec:AN_WgMeas} describes the details of the measurement and reports the results.\\
