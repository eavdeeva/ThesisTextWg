\subsection{Electroweak Interactions}
\label{sec:Intro_Electroweak}




All electrically charged particles participate in electromagnetic interactions. Photon, the mediator of the electromagnetic interactions, is a spin-one electrically neutral massless particle. All electromagnetic interactions can be reduced to one elementary process (Fig. \ref{fig:feynmEM}, left). This process represents an electron radiating or absorbing a photon. Although an electron is drawn in this figure, it can be any other charged particle as well. Such elementary process itself is forbidden by the energy conservation law but this element is a base of actual process (for example, Fig. \ref{fig:feynmEM}, middle and right). Such graphical representations of the particle physics processes are called Feynman diagrams.\\

As for the weak interactions, there are two kinds of them: neutral (mediated by a $Z$ boson) and charged (mediated by a $W^\pm$ boson). Elementary processes with $W$ and $Z$ bosons are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:feynmW}. Because the electric charge must be conserved at any vertex, a particle radiating or absorbing a $W$ boson converts to a different particle. Thus, a charged lepton converts to a neutrino (or vice versa) as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:feynmW}, top left. Each lepton carries a lepton flavor number (Tab. \ref{tab:LeptonFlavorNumber}). A lepton flavor number is conserved in any interaction, thus an electron radiating a $W$ boson  always converts to an electron neutrino, a muon converts to a muon neutrino etc.\\

     $\mu^+, \bar{\nu_{\mu}}$ &  0  &  -1  &  0  \\ \hline 
     $\tau^-,\nu_{\tau}$ &  0  &  0  &  +1  \\ \hline 
     $\tau^+, \bar{\nu_{\tau}}$ &  0  &  0  &  -1  \\ \hline

From top middle diagram in Fig. \ref{fig:feynmW} we see that if a quark with Q=$-$1/3 enters, then a quark with Q=$+$2/3 escapes and, therefore, the flavor of the quark has changed. The charged weak interaction is the only interaction which changes a quark flavor. The probability of each of three quarks with Q=$+$2/3 to be born is determined by the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix and is the highest for the quark of the same generation as an initial state quark. In this particular case, $d$ is the initial state quark and $u$ has the highest probability to be produced after an interaction with a $W$ boson but $c$ and $t$ can also be produced if there is enough energy.\\

An elementary process of a neutral weak interactions is an emission of a $Z$ boson off a fermion line (right top diagram in Fig. \ref{fig:feynmW}). An electron is shown here as an example however it could also be any lepton, antilepton, quark or antiquark. Diagrams with a $Z$ boson are very similar to ones with a photon except a photon can only be radiated off a charged particle but a $Z$ boson can also be radiated off a neutrino or antineutrino.\\

The bottom diagrams in Fig. \ref{fig:feynmW} are gauge bosons coupling diagrams including self-coupling of a $W$ boson, its interaction with a $Z$ boson and its electromagnetic radiation of a photon. $WWZ$, $WW\gamma$, $WWZZ$, $WWZ\gamma$, $WW\gamma\gamma$ and $WWWW$ vertices are all possible in the SM.\\

Electromagnetic and weak interactions are unified by the electroweak Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) theory which is based on SU(2)xU(1) symmetry. SU(2) is the symmetry of weak isospin which generates three bosons: $W^1$, $W^2$ and $W^3$. U(1) is the symmetry of the weak hypercharge and generate one neutral boson $B$. $W^1$ and $W^2$ are mixed to create $W^+$ and $W^-$ mediators while $W^3$ and $B$ are mixed to create a $Z$ boson and a photon. Therefore, the GWS theory considers electromagnetic and weak forces as different manifestations of the electroweak force. \\

However, weak interactions are mediated by heavy bosons ($M_W=80$ GeV, $M_Z=91$ GeV) while electromagnetic interactions are mediated by a massless photon, thus, the electroweak symmetry is broken. To explain this phenomenon, the Higgs mechanism was introduced. The mechanism predicted an existence of an additional boson: the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson was a missing piece of the SM for many years and was finally discovered in 2012 at LHC by ATLAS and CMS collaborations through the processes shown in Fig.\ref{fig:higgsProduction}.\\

The measurement in this dissertation is an electroweak measurement because the process involves a $W$ boson. It includes an interaction of a $W$ boson with leptons and quarks as well as the triple gauge coupling $WW\gamma$. Thus, the measurement is a good test of the SM electroweak theory.\\
