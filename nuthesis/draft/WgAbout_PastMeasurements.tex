\subsection{Measurements in the Past}
\label{sec:WgAbout_PastMeas}

ATGC parameters of $WW\gamma$ vertex can be probed in $W\gamma$, $WW$, and $WZ$ measurements. Limits on $\Delta \kappa_\gamma$ and $\lambda_\gamma$ constants from different D0~\cite{ref_D0_aTGC_comb}, LEP~\cite{ref_LEP_aTGC_comb}, ATLAS~\cite{ref_7TeV_ATLAS},~\cite{ref_ATLAS_WW_8TeV},~\cite{ref_ATLAS_VW_8TeV} and CMS~\cite{ref_7TeV_CMS},~\cite{ref_CMS_WW_7TeV},~\cite{ref_CMS_WW_8TeV},~\cite{ref_CMS_VW_7TeV} measurements are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:aTGC_cg}.\\

The most recent measurements of $W\gamma$ production were performed by CMS~\cite{ref_7TeV_CMS} and ATLAS~\cite{ref_7TeV_ATLAS} collaborations with $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$~GeV collected in~2011. The measurements are based on~5~fb$^-1$ and~4.6~fb$^-1$ of integrated luminosity with CMS and ATLAS respectively. Both collaborations considered two channels: $W\gamma\rightarrow\mu\nu\gamma$ and $W\gamma\rightarrow e\nu\gamma$.\\

Dibosons processes are rare in $pp$-collisions and analysts have to filter out events of their interest from many processes which are more likely to happen. To do that, variety of selection criteria is applied which reject most of background events increasing a signal fraction in the selected sample  as much as possible. However, even after all possible selection criteria are applied, majority of selected events are still background events and it is not possible to reduce the background any further without also significantly reducing signal.\\

The major source of such irreducible background is the fake photon background where hadronic jets are misidentified as photons. Such events originate from $W+$jets process mostly but $Z+$jets and $\bar{t}t+$jets events contribute to this source of the background as well. The second major background for the electron channel is the fake photon background where electron can be misidentified as a photon.  Such events are coming from $Z+$jets events. Other sources of backgrounds include real-$\gamma$ backgrounds, fake lepton + real photon and fake lepton + fake photon sources.\\

Both channels provide measurements of $p_T^\gamma$ spectra because this variable is the most sensitive to the potential ATGC. The $p_T^\gamma$ spectra of the selected events in data superimposed with selected events in the simulation of the signal and estimated background contribution for the muon and electron channels are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Wg7TeV_CMS_ptGamma} for CMS and in Fig.~\ref{fig:Wg7TeV_ATLAS_ptGamma} for ATLAS. Both measurements show a good agreement.\\

CMS provides measurements of the $P_T^\gamma$ spectrum, the total cross section within the phase spaces of $\Delta R>0.7$, $P_T^\gamma>15$~GeV, $P_T^\gamma>60$~GeV and $P_T^\gamma>90$~GeV, and limits on aTGC coupling constants. The phase space restrictions come from the considerations of the detector acceptance, reducing heavily background-dominated regions and theory.\\

ATLAS, in addition to the $P_T^\gamma$ spectrum, total cross section and limits, provides the differential cross section and cross section with different number of associated jets. No evidence of a new physics is observed.\\

In this dissertation we are measuring total and differential $d\sigma/d P_T^\gamma$ cross section however we do not derive limits on aTGC coupling constants. The measurement details and results are available in Chapter~\ref{sec:AN_WgMeas}.\\
