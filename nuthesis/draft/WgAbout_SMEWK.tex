\label{sec:WgAbout_SMEWK}

%Pich, 1

The SM is a gauge theory invariant under the local $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ transformation. $SU(3)_C$ stands for color transformations and, therefore, the $SU(3)_C$-invariant Lagrangian describes QCD: color interactions of quarks and antiquarks. The requirement to satisfy the gauge invariance generates eight massless gluons, and the non-abelian nature of the $SU(3)$ group generates self-interactions of gluons including three-gluon and four-gluon vertices.\\

The Lagrangian based on the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ symmetry descibes unified theory of electroweak interactions. The requirement of the local gauge invariant generates four massless vector bosons which are mediators of electromagnetic and weak interactions. The non-abelian structure of $SU(2)$ group introduces gauge boson couplings just like self-interactions of gluons appear in QCD.\\ 

While the vector bosons are generated by the gauge theory formalism to be massless, it is experimentally known that mediators of weak interactions are heavy particles with masses $M_W=80$~GeV and $M_Z=91$~GeV. To introduce these masses, the electroweak symmetry has to be spontaneously broken to the QED symmetry group $U(1)$:\\

$SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y \rightarrow U(1)_{QED}$\\

The Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) introduces an additional particle into the SM: a Higgs boson ($H$) and generates masses for $W$ and $Z$ bosons. A photon is a massless particle, therefore, $U(1)_{QED}$ symmetry remains unbroken and a photon does not couple to a Higgs boson.\\

The Lagrangian transformations of the SM are described in \cite{ref_Pich} for QED, QCD, unified electroweak force and the Higgs mechanism. The measurement in this dissertation provides a test for the electroweak sector of the SM, thus we will repeat here the theoretical path from the Lagrangians of free particles to the accomodation of the electroweak gauge bosons including their self-couplings to explain better what model is tested.\\

%Pich, 3.1
It is experimentally known that dynamics of weak interactions depends on particle's helicity \cite{ref_Griffiths}. Thus, only left-handed fermions and only right-handed antifermions couple to a $W$ boson. A $Z$ boson couples to both left-handed and right-handed fermions and antifermions except neutrinos but with different strength while photon-fermion couplings do not depend on helicity but on electric charge only. As for the neutrinos, only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos found to couple to a $Z$ boson, therefore, right-handed neutrinos and left-handed antineutrinos were not found to participate in any SM interactions and even their existence is under the question.\\

Given different properties of left-handed and right-handed particles, they are treated differently by the electroweak theory. $SU(2)$ doublets are introduced for the wave functions of left-handed particles while $SU(2)$ singlets are introduced for the wave functions of right-handed particles. Eq.~\ref{eq:psi_for_quarks} and Eq.~\ref{eq:psi_for_leptons} show wave functions for the first generation fermions, however wave functions for the other two generations are constructed the same way.\\ 
 
%Pich 3.2

\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi_for_quarks}
\psi_1(x)=\begin{pmatrix} u \\ d' \end{pmatrix}_L \text{, } \psi_2(x)=u_R \text{, } \psi_3(x)=d'_R \text{.}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi_for_leptons}
\psi_1(x)=\begin{pmatrix} \nu_e \\ e^- \end{pmatrix}_L \text{, } \psi_2(x)=\nu_{eR} \text{, } \psi_3(x)=e^-_R \text{. }
\end{equation}

The state $d'$ is a mixture of $d$, $c$ and $b$ quark's wave functions and is deternimed by the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix \cite{ref_Pich}:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix} d' \\ c' \\ b' \end{pmatrix} = V
  \begin{pmatrix} d \\ c \\ b \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Consider the free Lagrangian:\\

\begin{equation}\label{eq:L_free}
L_0 = \sum_{j=1}^{3} i \bar{\psi_j}(x) \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi_j(x) 
\end{equation}

where $\gamma^\mu$ are Dirac matrices \cite{ref_Griffiths}.\\

The wave function $\psi_1$ changes under the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ transformations in the following way:\\

\begin{equation}
\psi_1(x) \rightarrow e^{i y_1 \beta} U_L \psi_1(x)
\end{equation}


The wave functions $\psi_{(2,3)}(x)$ are singlets of $SU(2)_L$ and are affected only by $U(1)$ transformations:\\

\begin{equation}
\psi_{(2,3)}(x) \rightarrow e^{i y_{(2,3)} \beta} \psi_{(2,3)}(x)
\end{equation}

The transformation $U_L \equiv e^{i \sigma_i \alpha_i /2}$, $\sigma_i$ are Pauli matrices \cite{ref_Griffiths}, $\alpha_i(x)$ and $\beta(x)$ are arbitrary functions, $y_{(1,2,3)}$ are hypercharges which are named analogous to electric charges in QED.\\

In order to satisfy the local Largangian invariance, partial derivatives in Eq.~\ref{eq:L_free} has to be substituted with covariant derivatives:\\

\begin{equation}
D_\mu \psi_1(x) = [\partial_\mu - i g {\tilde{W}}_\mu(x) - i g' y_1 B_\mu(x) ] \psi_1(x) 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
D_\mu \psi_{(2,3)}(x) = [\partial_\mu - i g' y_{(2,3)} B_\mu(x) ] \psi_{(2,3)}(x) 
\end{equation}

where ${\tilde{W}}_\mu(x) \equiv \frac{\sigma_i}{2} W_\mu^i(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\begin{pmatrix}
\sqrt{2} W_\mu^3 & (W_\mu^1 - i W_\mu^2)/{\sqrt{2}}\\
(W_\mu^1 + i W_\mu^2)/{\sqrt{2}} & -W_\mu^3\\
\end{pmatrix}$.

The Lagrangian becomes:\\ \\

\begin{equation}\label{eq:L_free_covariant}
L_0 \rightarrow L = \sum_{j=1}^{3} i \bar{\psi_j}(x) \gamma^\mu D_\mu \psi_j(x) 
\end{equation}


The Lagrangian $L$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:L_free_covariant} is now invariant under local $SU(2)_L \times U(1)$ transformations. Four vector boson fields appear in $L$: $B_\mu$, $W_\mu^1$, $W_\mu^2$, $W_\mu^3$.  Thus, it is necessary to add terms for kinetic energies of the vector bosons:\\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_gauge_kin}
L_{KIN}=-\frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{4}W_{\mu\nu}^i W^{\mu\nu}_i
\end{equation}

where $B_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_\mu B_\nu - \partial_\nu B_\mu$, $W_{\mu\nu}^i \equiv \partial_\mu W_\nu^i - \partial_\nu W_\mu^i + g \epsilon^{ijk} W_\mu^j W_\nu^k$\\

Off-diagonal terms of ${\tilde{W}}_\mu$ are wave functions of charged vector bosons $W^{\pm}=W_\mu^1 \mp i W_\mu^2)/{\sqrt{2}}$ while $W_\mu^3$ and $B_\mu$ are neutral fields corresponding to a $Z$ boson and a photon. However, $W_\mu^3$ couples to left-handed fermions and right-handed antifermions only while a $Z$ boson is known to interact with particles of both helicities.\\

Then the neutral electroweak mixing is introduced:\\

\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix} W_\mu^3 \\ B_\mu \end{pmatrix} \equiv
  \begin{pmatrix} \cos \theta_W & \sin \theta_W \\ -\sin \theta_W & \cos \theta_W \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix} Z_\mu \\ A_\mu \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation} 

where $\theta_W$ is an electroweak mixing angle, $A_\mu$ is a photon field.\\

Terms involving $A_\mu$ in the electroweak Largangian must be equal to the corresponding terms in QED Lagrangian \cite{ref_Pich}:\\

\begin{equation}\label{eq:L_QED}
L_{QED} = i \bar{\psi}(x) \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi(x) - m \bar{\psi}(x) \psi(x) + e Q A_\mu(x) \bar{\psi}(x) \gamma^\mu \psi(x) - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}(x) F^{\mu\nu}(x)
\end{equation}

where $F_{\mu\nu} \equiv \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu$.

This requirement relates $g$, $g'$, $\theta_W$ and $e$ as $g \sin \theta_W = g' \cos \theta_W = e$ and provides expression for weak hypercharges: $Y = Q - T_3$,\\

where $T_3 = \sigma_3 / 2$, $Q_1 = \begin{pmatrix} Q_{u/\nu} & 0 \\ 0 & Q_{d/e} \end{pmatrix}$, $Q_2 = Q_{u/\nu}$, $Q_3=Q_{d/e}$.\\

Writing $\tilde{W}_\mu$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:L_gauge_kin} explicitely, we will receive TGC and QGC coupling terms: 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_TGC_1}
L_{TGC} = -\frac{g}{4}(\partial_\mu W_\nu^i - \partial_\nu W_\mu^i)\epsilon^{ijk}W^{\mu j}W^{\nu k} - \frac{g}{4}\epsilon^{ijk}W_\mu^j W_\nu^k (\partial^\mu W^{\nu i} - \partial^\nu W^{\mu i})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_QGC_1}
L_{QGC} = -\frac{g^2}{4} \epsilon^{ijk} \epsilon^{ilm} W_\mu^j W_\nu^k W^{\mu l} W^{\nu m}
\end{equation}

Substitute $W_\mu^i$ and $B_\mu$ in Eq.~\ref{eq:L_TGC_1} and Eq.~\ref{eq:L_QGC_1} with the wave functions of $W^\pm$, $Z$ and a photon:\\

\begin{equation} \label{eq:EWK_Zg_bosons_mixing}
B_\mu = -\sin \theta_W Z_\mu + \cos \theta_W A_\mu \text{, } W_\mu^3 = \cos \theta_W Z_\mu + \sin \theta_W A_\mu
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:EWK_Zg_bosons_mixing}
W_\mu^1 = \sqrt{2}(W^+ + W^-) \text{, }W_\mu^2 = \sqrt{2}(W^- + W^+)
\end{equation}

we will receive charged TGC and QGC Lagrangians in the forms Eq.~\ref{eq:L_TGC_2} and Eq.~\ref{eq:L_QGC_2} which involve $WWZ$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:L_TGC_2_1}), $WW\gamma$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:L_TGC_2_2}), $WWWW$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:L_QGC_2_1}), $WWZZ$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:L_QGC_2_2}), $WWZ\gamma$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:L_QGC_2_3}), and $WW\gamma\gamma$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:L_QGC_2_4}) interactions.\\


\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_TGC_2}
L_{TGC} = L_{TGC}^{(1)} + L_{TGC}^{(2)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_TGC_2_1}
L_{TGC}^{(1)} = -ie \cot \theta_W (W^{-\mu\nu} W^{+}_\mu Z_\nu - W^{+\mu\nu} W^-_\mu Z_\nu +W^-_\mu W^+_\nu Z^{\mu\nu}) 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_TGC_2_2}
L_{TGC}^{(2)} = - ie(W^{-\mu\nu}W^+_\mu A_\nu - W^{+\mu\nu}W^-_\mu A_\nu + W^-_\mu W^+_\nu A^{\mu\nu})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_QGC_2}
L_{QGC} = L_{QGC}^{(1)} + L_{QGC}^{(2)} + L_{QGC}^{(3)} + L_{QGC}^{(4)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_QGC_2_1}
L_{QGC}^{(1)} = -\frac{e^2}{2\sin^2 \theta_W}(W^+_\mu W^{-\mu}W^+_\nu W^{-\nu} - W^+_\mu W^{\mu +} W^-_\nu W^{-\nu})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_QGC_2_2}
L_{QGC}^{(2)} = - e^2 \cot^2 \theta_W (W^+_\mu W^{-\mu} Z_\nu Z^{\nu} - W^+_\mu Z^{\mu} W^-_\nu Z^{\nu})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_QGC_2_3}
L_{QGC}^{(3)} = - e^2 \cot \theta_W (2 W_\mu^+ W^{-\mu} Z_\nu A^{\nu} - W^{+}_\mu Z^\mu W^-_\nu A^\nu - W^{+}_\mu A^\mu W^-_\nu Z^\nu)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:L_QGC_2_4}
L_{QGC}^{(4)} = - e^2 (W^+_\mu W^{-\mu} A_\nu A^{\nu} - W^+_\mu A^{\mu} W^-_\nu A^{\nu})
\end{equation}

In the measurement of this dissertation we probe $WW\gamma$ coupling.\\

The unified electroweak Lagrangian discussed above involves kinetic energy terms for fermions and gauge bosons as well as interactions of fermions with gauge bosons, TGC, and QGC. However, this Lagrangian does not contain any mass terms.\\

Because left-handed and right-handed wave functions transform differently under the electroweak symmetry, fermion mass terms of $\frac{1}{2} m_f^2 \bar{\psi} \psi$ would not be invariant and, therefore, are forbidden by the $SU(2) \times U(1)$ symmetry requirement. Mass terms for gauge bosons also would violate the Lagrangian invariance just as a photon mass term $\frac{1}{2} m^2 A^\mu A_\mu$ would violate $U(1)$ invariance of $L_{QED}$ \cite{ref_Griffiths}. Therefore, Largangian $L$ in Eq. \ref{eq:L_free_covariant} contains massless particles only.\\

To introduce masses into the electroweak Lagrangian, an $SU(2)_L$ doublet of complex scalar fields $\phi(x)$ is added to the Lagrangian:\\

\begin{equation}\label{eq:H_doublet}
  \phi(x) \equiv \begin{pmatrix} \phi^{(+)}(x) \\ \phi^{(0)}(x) \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

By selecting a special gauge of $\phi(x)$ it is possible to spontaneously break electroweak symmetry, generate a new scalar particle, a Higgs boson \cite{ref_Pich}, and introduce mass terms for $W$ and $Z$ bosons and charged fermions through their couplings to the Higgs boson. The strength of the coupling constant is proportional to the square of the particle's mass, therefore, heavier particles are more likel to interact with $H$, and massless particles do not couple to $H$.\\

The mechanism of generating a fermion's mass involve both left-handed and right-handed components of the fermion. If our hypothesis that right-handed neutrinos do not exist is right, then the Higgs mechanism does not generate neutrino masses. However, from the experiments of neutrino oscillations, neutrinos are known to have masses even though they are oreders of magnitude smaller than those of other fermions. Several hypotheses were offered to resolve this contradiction however at the moment the mechanism of neutrinos to acquire masses remain unknown \cite{ref_PDG}.\\
