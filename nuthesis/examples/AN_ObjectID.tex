\section{Object and Event selection}

\label{sec:ObjectSelection}
In this chapter we document the electron, muon, and photon identification and isolation criteria, $E_T^{MET}$ criteria, and provide the results of comparing simulation with data.
%We use cut-based selection of lepton + photon + MET where lepton is either muon or electron. 
%Photon and MET selection are a little bit different for different channels. 
%The second lepton veto is applied.  dR(lep,pho)$>$0.7 where $dR=\sqrt{({d\phi}^2+{d\eta}^2)}$ 
%is applied to avoid divergence of ISR and FSR contributions. No restrictions applied on a number of
% photons in the event but the candidate with the hardest photon is selected in the particular event among 
%those photons which passed all the other cuts including dR. dR is also a part of the phase space selection.\\
%The plot of total data vs MC after the selection criteria applied is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:DATAvsMC}.

\subsection{Object selection}

We select events with muons and photons in the final state fro the muon channel and events with electrons and photons in the final state for the electron channel. CMS Particle Object Group (POG) provides us with their recommendation for the relevant selection criteria for any given period of data-taking. For~2012 data recommendations included two sets of muon selection criteria: "Tight" and "Loose" and four sets of electron and photon selection criteria: "Tight", "Medium", "Loose" and "Veto".

For the muon selection, we applied the kinematics cuts of $p_T>25$ GeV and $|\eta|<2.1$ and "Tight" identification selection criteria. To reject events with two or more muons, like $Z\gamma\rightarrow\mu\mu\gamma$ events, we rejected all events that have the second reconstructed muon candidate with $P_T>10$ GeV and $|\eta|<2.4$. Data to MC scale factors are applied as recommended by CMS POG.

We consider electrons with $p_T>30$~GeV passing the "Tight" identification selection criteria and photons with $P_T>15$~GeV passing the modified "Medium" identification criteria. The modification of the photons selection criteria was studied in the $W\gamma\gamma \rightarrow l\nu\gamma\gamma$ measurement~\cite{Wgg8TeV}. 

In addition, electrons and photons must be within the ECal acceptance that is defined in terms of barrel (EB) and endcap (EE) sections with pseudorapidity ranges of $|\eta| < 1.4442$ and $1.566 < |\eta| < 2.5$, respectively. To reject events with two or more final state electrons, events with the second reconstructed electron candidate with $p_T>10$ GeV and satisfying the "Veto" identification selection criteria are rejected. No restrictions on the maximum number of the final state photons is applied. 

Selection criteria are applied consistently on the data sample as well as on all simulation samples. Due to various reasons, the selection efficiency may slightly differ between data and simulation. The efficiency ratios are called the scale factors. The scale factors for the selection criteria recommended by CMS POG are provided by CMS POG. For the modified photon identification criteria, the appropriate changes to the POG-recommended scale factors were applied derived by the $W\gamma\gamma$ team~\cite{Wgg8TeV}.

\subsection{Event Level Selection}

$W$ transverse mass cut is applied of $M_T^W>40$~GeV where $M_T=\sqrt{(2 \cdot P_T^{Lep} \cdot P_T^{MET} \cdot (1-\cos{(\phi^{lep}-\phi^{MET})}))}$. $E_T^{miss}$ reconstructed with particle flow algorithm was used~\cite{pfMET}. 

Z-mass window cut is applied in electron channel to suppress DYjets background: events which fall into the Z-mass window $70$~GeV$<M_{e\gamma}<110$~GeV are rejected.

dR(lep,pho)$>$0.7 where $dR=\sqrt{({d\phi}^2+{d\eta}^2)}$ is applied to avoid divergence of ISR and FSR contributions. No restrictions applied on a number of  photons in the event but the candidate with the hardest photon is selected in the particular event among         
those photons which passed all the other cuts including dR. dR is also a part of the phase space selection.

\subsection{Weights and Corrections}

The pile up reweighting is applied. Fig.~\ref{fig:DATAvsMC_nVtx} shows the distribution of the number of vertices for the $Z\gamma$ selected sample in muon channel before (left) and after (right) the pile up reweighting of the MC samples. The same procedure of the pile up reweighting is applied for the $W\gamma$ selected MC samples.

This is a policy of the CMS SMP group that all the analysis must be performed in a blinded way. We discussed how to implement blinding in our case with the statistics committee [REFERENCE] and were given the following recipe:
\begin{itemize}
  \item use all data for $p_T^{\gamma}<p_T^{\gamma-threshold}$, where $p_T^{\gamma-threshold}$ is the value after which the analysis becomes potentially sensitive to the new physics; and
  \item for $p_T^{\gamma}>p_T^{\gamma-threshold}$, use $X\%$ of data and pick  $X\%$ in such a way that $err_{stat} \geq 3 \cdot err_{syst}$.
\end{itemize}

We decided on $p_T^{\gamma-threshold}=45~GeV$ and, relying on systematic error of ~10\%, quoted by~7~TeV measurement [REFERENCE], on X\%=5\%. Therefore, our blinding strategy is:
\begin{itemize}
  \item for $p_T^{\gamma}<45~GeV$: use full data; and
  \item for $p_T^{\gamma}>45~GeV$: use $5\%$ of data.
\end{itemize}

Our $Wjets$, $DYjets$ and $t\bar{t}jets$ MC samples partially contain $W\gamma$, $Z\gamma$, $t\bar{t}\gamma$ events. To remove the overlap, we did the following, relying totally on the MC-truth information available in Wjets, DYjets, $t\bar{t}jets$ samples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item loop over all gen-level photons available in the ggNtuple;
  \item the event is removed from selected sample if at least one photon satisfy the following criteria:
  \begin{itemize}
     \item has $P_T^{\gamma}>10~GeV$;
     \item originates from lepton, boson or quark based on it's parentage information; and
     \item is separated by $dR(pho,lep)>0.4$ from at least one gen-muon or gen-electron, depending on the channel.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

A good data vs MC agreement for the $Z\gamma$ plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:DATAvsMC_nVtx} validates the procedure.

\subsection{Selected Events}

%Distributions of $P_T^{\gamma}$ and $M_T^W$ of the selected events are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:DATAvsMC} and \ref{fig:DATAvsMC_WMt}. 
%The is a large discrepancies in all the distributions and therefore the data-driven background estimates are necessary.\\

Distributions of $P_T^{\gamma}$ of the selected events are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DATAvsMC}. The is a large discrepancies in all the distributions and therefore the data-driven background estimates are necessary.
