\label{sec:Exp}

The measurement reported in this dissertation is based on data collected by the CMS detector from the LHC $pp$~collisions in~2012. Thus, the experimental setup for this measurement includes the LHC and the CMS detector that are described in Ch.~\ref{sec:Exp_LHC} and Ch.~\ref{sec:Exp_CMS} respectively.
