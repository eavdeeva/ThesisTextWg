This dissertation reports a measurement of the total and differential in $P_T^{\gamma}$ bins cross sections of the $W\gamma\rightarrow\mu\nu\gamma$ and $W\gamma\rightarrow e\nu\gamma$ processes using full~2012 dataset of $L=$19.6~fb$^{-1}$ collected by CMS at $\sqrt{s}=$8~TeV. This is the first measurement of the differential $W\gamma$ cross section with CMS. The results are in agreement between two channels and also agree with the MC-based cross section.

In addition to $W\gamma$ cross section, we also measure $Z\gamma$ cross section and compare results with the published $Z\gamma$ CMS measurement at $\sqrt{s}=$8~TeV. The good agreement between our and published results on $Z\gamma$ cross section validates parts of our $W\gamma$ measurement that are the same between $Z\gamma$ and $W\gamma$ measurements including lepton and photon selection, jets$\rightarrow\gamma$ background estimation, detector resolution unfolding, acceptance and efficiency corrections.

Measurements of $W\gamma$ at higher energies and luminosities and have more opportunities to discover a new physics if it is present. Diboson and triboson studies remain a significant part of CMS physics program for studies at $\sqrt{s}=$13~TeV.

%  \begin{itemize}
%     \item Cross section for muon and electron channels are computed 
%     \item This is the first measurement of the differential $W\gamma$ cross section with CMS
%     \item Results agree with the MC prediction
%     \item Results between the two channels agree
%     \item Relative systematic uncertainties on total cross section are larger than those reported by the CMS 7 TeV measurement
%     \item Good agreement in the $Z\gamma$ check validates most parts of the analysis (those which are the same for the muon and electron channels)
