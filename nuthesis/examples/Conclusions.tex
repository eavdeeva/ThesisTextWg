\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

This dissertation reports a measurement of the total and differential in $P_T^{\gamma}$ bins cross sections of the $W\gamma\rightarrow\mu\nu\gamma$ and $W\gamma\rightarrow e\nu\gamma$ processes with CMS using full 2012 dataset of $L=19.6$~fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV. This is the first measurement of the differential $W\gamma$ cross section with CMS. The results are in agreement between two channels and also agree with the MC-based cross section. The differential cross section can be used to derive limits on aTGC constants.

The measurement is systematically dominated. The relative systematic uncertainties on the total cross section are larger than those reported by the CMS measurement at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV. 

In addition to $W\gamma$ cross section, we also measured $Z\gamma$ cross section and compared results with the published $Z\gamma$ CMS measurement at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV. The good agreement between our and published results on $Z\gamma$ cross section validates parts of our $W\gamma$ measurement which are the same between $Z\gamma$ and $W\gamma$.

The $W\gamma$ measurement at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV will have more opportunities to discover a new physics if it is there because of higher statistical power and higher energy. Although the measurement is systematically dominated but many systematic uncertainties depend on statistical power of control samples, thus, the increased luminosity will help to reduce those uncerntainties. The reconstruction and identification algorithms are always improving, thus, other systematic uncertainties can be reduced in the future measurements as well.
