\section{Acceptance and Efficiency Correction}
\label{sec:AccXEff}

To compute the cross section in a phase space different from our selection criteria, it is necessary to apply the acceptance and efficiency corrections. They are computed as a single number which accumulates both acceptance and efficiency effects, separately for the total yield and for the differenctial yields. The correction is denoted as $A \times \epsilon$ and derived using the signal MC samples.  

The numerator $N^{A\epsilon}$ for the correction of the total yield is determined as the number of selected events in the signal MC with PU weight applied. The numerator $N^{A\epsilon}_i$ for the correction of the differential yields is determined as selected signal MC yields with PU weight applied in $P_T^{\gamma-GEN}$ bins at the gen-level. Index $i$ stands for $P_T^{\gamma}$ bins.

The denominator $D^{A\epsilon}$ of the $A \times \epsilon$ corretion is determined as the number of events that are within the phase space based on their gen-level kinematic values. For the correction $(A \times \epsilon)_i$ of the differential yields, the numbers $D^{A\epsilon}_{i}$ are determined separately for each $P_T^\gamma$ bin.  

The $A \times \epsilon$ correction is determined then as $A \times \epsilon = N/D$ for the total cross section and as $(A \times \epsilon)_i = N^{A\epsilon}_i/{D^{A\epsilon}_i}$ for the differential cross section where index $i$ stands for a $P_T^{\gamma}$ bin. The $A \times \epsilon$ for the total cross section are 0.2891$\pm$0.0006 for the muon channel and 0.1229$\pm$0.0004 for the electron channel. The uncerntainties are determined by the statistical power of the $W\gamma$ MC sample. The values of the $(A \times \epsilon)_i$ correction for the differential yields are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:covMatricesaccXeff_Wg}.

%To determine whether the event within the phase space or not, the following algorithm was used:
%\begin{itemize}
%   \item find a muon/electron which has a W boson as a mother particle
%   \item add 4-momenta of the dressing photons to the 4-momentum of the muon/electron; dressing photons as defined as photons that have $P_T>0.5$ GeV and have $\Delta R(lepton,photon)<0.1$
 %  \item find a final state photon which corresponds to FSR, ISR or TGC; exclude dressing photons from the consideration
 %  \item using 4-momentum of the photon and the adjusted 4-momentum of the lepton, determine whether the event is within the phase space or not
%\end{itemize}
