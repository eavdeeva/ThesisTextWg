\chapter{$W\gamma$ Cross Section Measurement}
\label{sec:AN_WgMeas}

The goal of the work reported in this dissertation is to measure the total and differential cross section of the $W\gamma$ production in $pp$ collisions as a function of the photon transverse momentum $P_T^\gamma$ at~$\sqrt{s}=$8~TeV center-of-mass collision energy. Decay channels $W\rightarrow\mu\nu$ and $W\rightarrow e\nu$ are considered. The measurement is performed using CMS data collected in~2012.

The phase space for the cross section was chosen taking into account the limitations on the event kinematics imposed by the trigger conditions during the data collection as well as by the detector acceptance, and considering the fact that the theoretical value for the cross section diverges at $P_T^{\gamma}=$0 and $\Delta{R}(\gamma,l)=$0. That phase space requirements on the final state photon and lepton match those of CMS $Z\gamma$ measurement at~8~TeV~\cite{ref_Zg8TeV} which also had to consider all the listed factors. The full list of the phase space requirements include:
%  Applied at generator-level to compute acceptance and MC-based cross section;\\
%  (tried to follow to the phase space definition of the approved Z$\gamma$ analysis [AN-2013-280] as close as possible)
\begin{itemize}
  \item $P_T^{\gamma}>$15 GeV;
  \item $\Delta{R}(\gamma,l) > $0.7;
  \item $|\eta^{\gamma}|<$2.5, $|\eta^{l}|<$2.5;
  \item $P_T^{l}>$20 GeV;
  \item $I^{\gamma}<$5 GeV, where $I_{\gamma}$ is a sum of $P_T$ of all particles $p$ in the event within $\Delta{R(p,\gamma)}<$0.3.
%  \item for Z$\gamma$ Check: M(lep,lep)$>$50 GeV
%  \item for differential cross section, $P_T^{\gamma}$ binning: $15-20-25-30-35-45-55-65-75-85-95-120-500$~GeV.
\end{itemize}
\noindent{$P_T^{\gamma}$ ranges (binning) for the differential cross section measurement was chosen to match the CMS $Z\gamma$ measurement. The $P_T^\gamma$ bin boundaries are 15-20-25-30-35-45-55-65-75-85-95-120-500~GeV.}
