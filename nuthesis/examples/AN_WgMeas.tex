\chapter{$W\gamma$ Cross Section Measurement}
\label{sec:AN_WgMeas}

The goal of this research is to measure the total and differential cross section of the $W\gamma$ production in $pp$ collisions as a function of the photon transverse momentum $P_T^\gamma$ at~$\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV center-of-mass collision energy. Decay channels $W\rightarrow\mu\nu$ and $W\rightarrow e\nu$ are considered. The measurement is performed using CMS data collected in~2012.
