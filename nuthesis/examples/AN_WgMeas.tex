\chapter{$W\gamma$ Cross Section Measurement}
\label{sec:AN_WgMeas}

The goal of this research is to measure the total and differential cross section of the $W\gamma$ production in $pp$ collisions as a function of the photon transverse momentum $P_T^\gamma$ at~$\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV center-of-mass collision energy. Decay channels $W\rightarrow\mu\nu$ and $W\rightarrow e\nu$ are considered. The measurement is performed using CMS data collected in~2012.

The phase space for the cross section was chosen from the theoretical considerations of a divergence at $P_T^{\gamma}=0$ and $\Delta{R}(\gamma,l)=0$, from the consideraion of the trigger requirements (Ch.~\ref{sec:DataAndMC}) and detector acceptance and also was chosen to match the phase space of CMS $Z\gamma$ measurement at~8~TeV for the comparison purpose. The full list of the phase space requirements include:
%  Applied at generator-level to compute acceptance and MC-based cross section;\\
%  (tried to follow to the phase space definition of the approved Z$\gamma$ analysis [AN-2013-280] as close as possible)
\begin{itemize}
  \item $P_T^{\gamma}>15$ GeV;
  \item $\Delta{R}(\gamma,l) > 0.7$;
  \item $|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.5$, $|\eta^{l}|<2.5$;
  \item $P_T^{l}>20$ GeV;
  \item $I^{\gamma}<5$ GeV, where $I_{\gamma}$ is a sum of $P_T$ of all MC generated particles particles $p$ in the event within $\Delta{R(p,\gamma)}<0.3$.
%  \item for Z$\gamma$ Check: M(lep,lep)$>$50 GeV
%  \item for differential cross section, $P_T^{\gamma}$ binning: $15-20-25-30-35-45-55-65-75-85-95-120-500$~GeV.
\end{itemize}
\noindent{$P_T^{\gamma}$ binning for the differential cross section measurement was also chosen to match CMS $Z\gamma$ measurement. $P_T^\gamma$ bin boundaries are $15$-$20$-$25$-$30$-$35$-$45$-$55$-$65$-$75$-$85$-$95$-$120$-$500$~GeV.}
