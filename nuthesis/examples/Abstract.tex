%This dissertation reports a measurement of the total and differential in $P_T^{\gamma}$ bins cross sections of the $W\gamma\rightarrow\mu\nu\gamma$ and $W\gamma\rightarrow e\nu\gamma$ processes with CMS using full 2012 dataset of $L=19.6$~fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV. This is the first measurement of the differential $W\gamma$ cross section with CMS. The results are in agreement between two channels and also agree with the MC-based cross section.

The measurement of $W\gamma\rightarrow l\nu\gamma$ total and differential cross section is reported. The measurement was performed with CMS at LHC center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV. The electron and the muon channels are considered. This is the first measurement of the $W\gamma\rightarrow l\nu\gamma$ cross section at CMS. No deviation from the Standard Model has been observed.
