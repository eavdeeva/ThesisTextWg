The measurement of $W\gamma\rightarrow l\nu\gamma$ total and differential cross section is reported. The measurement was performed with CMS at LHC center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=$8~TeV. The electron and the muon channels are considered. This is the first measurement of the $W\gamma\rightarrow l\nu\gamma$ cross section at CMS. No deviation from the Standard Model has been observed.
