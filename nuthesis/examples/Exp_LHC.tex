The LHC~\cite{ref_LHC_brochure,ref_LHC_TDR,ref_LHC_website} is the largest particle accelerator and the most ambitious particle physics research facility ever built. The LHC accelerates two particle beams up to near the speed of light. The beams travel in opposite directions, each in its own beam pipe, in ultrahigh vacuum. The beam is made up of protons which are grouped as bunches separated by several meters from each other. Each bunch contains~$10^{11}$~protons. The bunches of protons are accelerated by varying electromagnetic fields, focused by superconducting quadrupole magnets and steered by dipole magnets. The bunches collide at fixed collision points where particle detectors are placed. Particles are produced in the collisions and registered by the detectors to be subsequently used to accomplish physics goals of the experiments.

%Beams travel in vacuum in beampipes
%Beam structure is bunches (define what they are)
%Bunches are accelerated by varying EM field in RF cavities
%Bunches are focused by focusing superconducting quadrupole magnets
%Bunches are steered by dipole magnets

The LHC is located in the tunnel at the France-Switzerland border. The tunnel is located as deep as~175~meters underground, its circumference is about~27~km.

Before entering LHC, particle beams go through several stages of acceleration, and the LHC is the final machine of the chain of the CERN's accelerator complex (Fig.~\ref{fig:CERN_accelerator_complex}). Protons are extracted from hydrogen atoms, are accelerated by Linac2 to energies of~5~MeV, and are then injected into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) where they reach energies of~1.4~GeV. After that, protons are sent to PS and then to Super PS (SPS) where they are accelerated up to~25~GeV and~450~GeV respectively. Finally, protons enter the LHC and are accelerated to reach their collision energies of several TeV per beam. Besides protons, the complex also accelerates and collides lead ions. However, in this dissertation we analyze data from $pp$ collisions only.

%Main goals of LHC were to detect the SM Higgs boson if it existed and to search for evidences of BSM physics which may give a clue on understanding the phenomena including but not limited to the dark matter, the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the nature of the gravitational force. 

Six detectors are installed at the LHC to detect products of hadron collisions and to perform the measurements of the LHC physics program. ATLAS and CMS are general purpose detectors designed to explore a broad spectrum of particle physics questions within and beyond the SM, LHCb specializes in the physics of B mesons, ALICE is designed to detect products of heavy ion collisions, LHCf and TOTEM are small detectors with very specialized research goals. LHCf and TOTEM are installed close to the ATLAS and CMS collision points respectively and are referred as forward detectors. 

%The greatest achievement by the LHC today is the discovery of the Higgs boson in~2012 by the CMS~\cite{ref_HiggsPaperCMS} and the ATLAS~\cite{ref_HiggsPaperATLAS} collaborations.

%LHC is constructed of eight arcs, each arc corresponds to a sector as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LHCsectors}. In between there are eight insertions where beams are either collided or injected or dumped or cleaned. On the other hand, LHC is split on eight octants, each starting from the middle of one sector and ending at the middle of the next one. Thus, each octant includes one full insertion.\\ 

The design collision energy of the LHC is $\sqrt{s}=14$~TeV which corresponds to~$7$~TeV per beam. However, several lower energy points were probed. In~2010-2011 the LHC operated at an energy of~$3.5$~TeV per beam which was already higher than the energy of any other collider. In~2012 the energy was increased up to~$4$~GeV. In~2013-2014 the LHC was shut down for upgrades. Collisions were restarted at~$6.5$~TeV in~2015 and continued at this energy in~2016. LHC beams are always of equal energy.

All critical measurements performed at lower energies are also repeated at higher energies. For the BSM searches, the ability to probe higher energy scales increases our chances for a discovery. For a SM cross section measurement, it needs to be done at all energies and compared to the theory since cross sections evolve with energy. The cross sections of many interesting processes increase with energy because in a collision of higher energy hadrons more parton-parton pairs have center-of-mass energy above any given threshold. This enables the observation of rarer processes. Cross sections of different processes in $pp$ collisions and their energy dependencies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LHC_totalCS}.

%While different BSM searches have been constituting a significant part of the LHC physics program since the beginning of its operation, no deviations from the SM were found by any of the experiments. The searches continue with higher beam energies and larger amount of data.

In addition to the beam energy, there are many other collider parameters which reflect the ability of the collider to achieve stated goals. A brief summary of them is available in Tab.~\ref{tab:LHCparameters}. One of the most critical parameters of an accelerator is the luminosity which determines how many interesting events can be produced (Ch.~\ref{sec:WgAbout_LumiAndCS}). The instantaneous luminosity is determined by the following expression~\cite{ref_PDG}:

\begin{equation}
L = f \frac{n_1 n_2}{4 \pi \sigma_x \sigma_y}
\end{equation}

\noindent{where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are numbers of particles in colliding bunches, $f$ is a frequency of collisions, $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ characterize sizes of overlapping parts of colliding beams in horizontal and vertical directions. The instantaneous luminosity multiplied by a cross section of a process gives an event rate (Eq.~\ref{eq:L_eventRate}) of this specific process. If we know the instantaneuos luminosity and the theoretically predicted cross section of the process, we can estimate how many events per unit time of this particular process will be produced by our experiment. To estimate how many events of the process will be produced during a certain time period, we have to use the integrated luminosity which is an integral of the instantaneous luminosity over time:}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:integratedL}
  L_{int}=\int L dt
\end{equation}

\noindent{The integrated luminosity of a data sample is a measure of the size of the data sample.}

The integrated luminosity of the LHC for $pp$ collisions for different years of the operation is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:LHClumi}. Run~I of the LHC operation covers run periods of~2010-2012. While running at the energy of $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV, LHC delivered~$L_{int}=45$~pb$^{-1}$ and~$L_{int}=6.1$~fb$^{-1}$ of data in~2010 and~2011 year respectively. In~2012 the working energy of LHC was $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV, and the integrated luminosity was $L_{int}=23.3$~fb$^{-1}$.  After a long shutdown, LHC was upgraded for Run~II, to operate at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV in~2015 and delivered~$L_{int}=4.2$~fb$^{-1}$ of data by the end of~2015. In~2016 LHC continued operating at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV and delivered the integrated luminosity of~$L_{int}=41.1$~fb$^{-1}$~\cite{ref_LHClumi_twiki}.

The measurement of this dissertation is performed at the energy of~$4$~TeV per beam or the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV with~19.6~fb$^{-1}$ of data collected in~2012. The same process was measured at $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV with about four times less data by both CMS and ATLAS. These measurements are discussed in greater detail in Ch.~\ref{sec:WgAbout_PastMeas}.
